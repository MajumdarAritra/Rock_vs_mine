# Rock_vs_mine
# Overview<br>
The Rock vs. Mine classification project uses Logistic Regression to classify sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine." This project involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation to accurately distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar signals.<br>

# Features<br>
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing sonar signal data for classification, including handling missing values and feature scaling.<br>
Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting relevant features from sonar signal data.<br>
Logistic Regression: Implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify sonar signals.<br>
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the Logistic Regression model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
